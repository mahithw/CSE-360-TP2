/**
 * <p>Title: ParticipationSummaryGenerator Class</p>
 * 
 * <p>Description: Generates participation statistics for instructional team grading.
 * This class analyzes student discussion posts and replies to determine whether each
 * student has answered questions from at least N different classmates.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The core functionality helps instructors quickly identify which students meet
 * participation requirements and which need reminders to engage with more peers.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Copyright: Student Discussion System © 2025</p>
 * 
 * @version 1.00 — 2025-11-24 Initial implementation for TP3
 * 
 * <p>Tested by: ParticipationSummaryGeneratorTest - JUnit test suite with boundary
 * value and coverage tests</p>
 * 
 * <p>Satisfies User Story: "As an instructor, I need to see which students have
 * answered questions from at least 3 different classmates so I can fairly assess
 * participation."</p>
